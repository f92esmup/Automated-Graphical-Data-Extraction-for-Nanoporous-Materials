 2. ChatGPT: Working with large Language Models (LLMs)

What is a typical large language model (LLM)?
A text completion model. It simply continues the provided input text
by adding the next most likely word (token, i.e., a few symbols, part of word,
short word, etc.)

In brief:
 - Input: text
 - Loop until the next predicted word is "END":
    1) Output: text + predicted next "word"
    2) Input = Output
 - Output: continuation of your text.


Trained on large amounts of text by hiding parts of it and trying
to predict them back.

abstr = "Modulated reflectance (contactless electroreflectance (CER), photoreflectance (PR), and piezoreflectance (PzR)) has been applied to study direct optical transitions in bulk MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. In order to interpret optical transitions observed in CER, PR, and PzR spectra, the electronic band structure for the four crystals has been calculated from the first principles within the density functional theory for various points of Brillouin zone including K and H points. It is clearly shown that the electronic band structure at H point of Brillouin zone is very symmetric and similar to the electronic band structure at K point, and therefore, direct optical transitions at H point should be expected in modulated reflectance spectra besides the direct optical transitions at the K point of Brillouin zone. This prediction is confirmed by experimental studies of the electronic band structure of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 crystals by CER, PR, and PzR spectroscopy, i.e., techniques which are very sensitive to critical points of Brillouin zone. For the four crystals besides the A transition at K point, an AH transition at H point has been observed in CER, PR, and PzR spectra a few tens of meV above the A transition. The spectral difference between A and AH transition has been found to be in a very good agreement with theoretical predictions. The second transition at the H point of Brillouin zone (BH transition) overlaps spectrally with the B transition at K point because of small energy differences in the valence (conduction) band positions at H and K points. Therefore, an extra resonance which could be related to the BH transition is not resolved in modulated reflectance spectra at room temperature for the four crystals."

"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially in two-dimensional (2D) form, exhibit many properties desirable for device applications. However, device performance can be hindered by the presence of defects. Here, we combine state of the art experimental and computational approaches to determine formation energies and charge transition levels of defects in bulk and 2D MX 2 (Mâ€‰=â€‰Mo or W; Xâ€‰=â€‰S, Se, or Te). We perform deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements of bulk TMDs. Simultaneously, we calculate formation energies and defect levels of all native point defects, which enable identification of levels observed in DLTS and extend our calculations to vacancies in 2D TMDs, for which DLTS is challenging. We find that reduction of dimensionality of TMDs to 2D has a significant impact on defect properties. This finding may explain differences in optical properties of 2D TMDs synthesized with different methods and lays foundation for future developments of more efficient TMD-based devices.",
"We use a random forest (RF) model to predict the critical cooling rate (RC) for glass formation of various alloys from features of their constituent elements. The RF model was trained on a database that integrates multiple sources of direct and indirect RC data for metallic glasses to expand the directly measured RC database of less than 100 values to a training set of over 2000 values. The model error on 5-fold cross-validation (CV) is 0.66 orders of magnitude in K/s. The error on leave-out-one-group CV on alloy system groups is 0.59 log units in K/s when the target alloy constituents appear more than 500 times in training data. Using this model, we make predictions for the set of compositions with melt-spun glasses in the database and for the full set of quaternary alloys that have constituents which appear more than 500 times in training data. These predictions identify a number of potential new bulk metallic glass systems for future study, but the model is most useful for the identification of alloy systems likely to contain good glass formers rather than detailed discovery of bulk glass composition regions within known glassy systems.",
"The electronic band structure of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, crystals has been studied at various hydrostatic pressures experimentally by photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy and theoretically within the density functional theory (DFT). In the PR spectra direct optical transitions (A and B) have been clearly observed and pressure coefficients have been determined for these transitions to be: Î±Aâ€‰=â€‰2.0â€‰Â±â€‰0.1 and Î±Bâ€‰=â€‰3.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.1â€‰meV/kbar for MoS2, Î±Aâ€‰=â€‰2.3â€‰Â±â€‰0.1 and Î±Bâ€‰=â€‰4.0â€‰Â±â€‰0.1â€‰meV/kbar for MoSe2, Î±Aâ€‰=â€‰2.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.1 and Î±Bâ€‰=â€‰4.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.1â€‰meV/kbar for WS2, Î±Aâ€‰=â€‰3.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.1 and Î±Bâ€‰=â€‰5.0â€‰Â±â€‰0.5â€‰meV/kbar for WSe2. It has been found that these coefficients are in an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. In addition, a comparative study of different computational DFT approaches has been performed and analyzed. For indirect gap the pressure coefficient have been determined"]
