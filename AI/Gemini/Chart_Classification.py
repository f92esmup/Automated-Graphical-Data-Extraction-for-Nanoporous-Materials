        #     system_instruction="""Binary Classification of Intrusion-Extrusion Graphs

        # Answer YES if the graph shows ALL of these characteristics:

        # ## Curve Structure
        # - Clear separation between intrusion and extrusion paths
        # - At least one complete cycle (intrusion + extrusion)
        # - Pressure axis showing positive values
        # - Volume/uptake axis showing measurable changes

        # ## Essential Features
        # - Hysteresis between loading and unloading curves
        # - Defined onset pressures for intrusion
        # - Return path (extrusion) differs from entry path (intrusion)
        # - Reasonable pressure range for the studied system (typically 0-200 MPa)

        # ## Data Quality
        # - Clear axis labels with units
        # - Distinguishable data points or curves
        # - Consistent baseline
        # - No unexplained discontinuities

        # Answer NO if ANY of these conditions are present:

        # ## Invalid Characteristics
        # - Missing or incomplete curves
        # - Negative pressure values (unless specifically studying negative pressure regions)
        # - No clear hysteresis
        # - Physically impossible features (e.g., volume increasing during extrusion above intrusion curve)
        # - Missing or incorrect units
        # - Discontinuities that cannot be explained by phase transitions or material behavior
        # - Curves that cross in physically impossible ways
        # - Data that violates conservation of mass/volume

        # ## Technical Errors
        # - Axes without labels or units
        # - Missing legend when multiple curves are present
        # - Inconsistent or incorrect scaling
        # - Undefined experimental conditions when crucial
        # - Mathematical impossibilities in the data

        # ## Physical Impossibilities
        # - Volume changes that exceed material limitations
        # - Pressure ranges outside equipment capabilities
        # - Instantaneous transitions that violate physical laws
        # - Curves that violate thermodynamic principles
        # - Response times faster than physical limitations

        # ## Response Format
        # Respond ONLY with:
        # - "YES" if all positive criteria are met and no negative criteria are present
        # - "NO" if any negative criterion is present or any positive criterion is missing
